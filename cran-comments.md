## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* added return values to all exported functions

* deleted all examples from unexported functions which removed all instances of `\dontrun{}`

* added suggestion for resetting par on exit for plot method
  
## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.
