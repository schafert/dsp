\arguments{
\item{y}{the \code{T x 1} vector of time series observations}

\item{evol_error}{the evolution error distribution; must be one of
'DHS' (dynamic horseshoe prior), 'HS' (horseshoe prior), 'BL' (Bayesian lasso), or 'NIG' (normal-inverse-gamma prior)}

\item{zero_error}{the shrinkage-to-zero distribution; must be one of
'DHS' (dynamic horseshoe prior), 'HS' (horseshoe prior), 'BL' (Bayesian lasso), or 'NIG' (normal-inverse-gamma prior)}

\item{D}{degree of differencing (D = 1, or D = 2)}

\item{nsave}{number of MCMC iterations to record}

\item{nburn}{number of MCMC iterations to discard (burin-in)}

\item{nskip}{number of MCMC iterations to skip between saving iterations,
i.e., save every (nskip + 1)th draw}

\item{mcmc_params}{named list of parameters for which we store the MCMC output;
must be one or more of:
\itemize{
\item "mu" (conditional mean)
\item "yhat" (posterior predictive distribution)
\item "evol_sigma_t2" (evolution error variance)
\item "zero_sigma_t2" (shrink-to-zero error variance)
\item "obs_sigma_t2" (observation error variance)
\item "dhs_phi" (DHS AR(1) coefficient for evolution error)
\item "dhs_mean" (DHS AR(1) unconditional mean for evolution error)
\item "dhs_phi_zero" (DHS AR(1) coefficient for shrink-to-zero error)
\item "dhs_mean_zero" (DHS AR(1) unconditional mean for shrink-to-zero error)
}}

\item{computeDIC}{logical; if TRUE, compute the deviance information criterion \code{DIC}
and the effective number of parameters \code{p_d}}

\item{verbose}{logical; should R report extra information on progress?}
}
\value{
A named list of the \code{nsave} MCMC samples for the parameters named in \code{mcmc_params}
}
\description{
Sparse Bayesian trend filtering has two penalties:
(1) a penalty on the first (D = 1) or second (D = 2) differences of the conditional expectation and
(2) a penalty on the conditional expectation, i.e., shrinkage to zero.
}
\details{
Each penalty is determined by a prior, which include:
\itemize{
\item the dynamic horseshoe prior ('DHS');
\item the static horseshoe prior ('HS');
\item the Bayesian lasso ('BL');
\item the normal stochastic volatility model ('SV');
\item the normal-inverse-gamma prior ('NIG').
}
In each case, the prior is a scale mixture of Gaussians.
Sampling is accomplished with a (parameter-expanded) Gibbs sampler,
mostly relying on a dynamic linear model representation.
}
\note{
The data \code{y} may contain NAs, which will be treated with a simple imputation scheme
via an additional Gibbs sampling step. In general, rescaling \code{y} to have unit standard
deviation is recommended to avoid numerical issues.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Example 1: Bumps Data
simdata = simUnivariate(signalName = "bumps", T = 128, RSNR = 7, include_plot = TRUE)
y = simdata$y

out = btf_sparse(y)
plot_fitted(y, mu = colMeans(out$mu), postY = out$yhat, y_true = simdata$y_true)

# Example 2: Doppler Data; longer series, more noise
simdata = simUnivariate(signalName = "doppler", T = 500, RSNR = 5, include_plot = TRUE)
y = simdata$y

out = btf_sparse(y)
plot_fitted(y, mu = colMeans(out$mu), postY = out$yhat, y_true = simdata$y_true)

# And examine the AR(1) parameters for the log-volatility w/ traceplots:
plot(as.ts(out$dhs_phi)) # AR(1) coefficient
plot(as.ts(out$dhs_mean)) # Unconditional mean

# Example 3: Blocks data (locally constant)
simdata = simUnivariate(signalName = "blocks", T = 1000, RSNR = 3, include_plot = TRUE)
y = simdata$y

out = btf_sparse(y, D = 1) # try D = 1 to approximate the locally constant behavior
plot_fitted(y, mu = colMeans(out$mu), postY = out$yhat, y_true = simdata$y_true)
