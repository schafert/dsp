Description: Provides efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms for 
    dynamic shrinkage processes, which extend global-local shrinkage priors to 
    the time series setting by allowing shrinkage to depend on its own past. 
    These priors yield locally adaptive estimates, useful for time series and 
    regression functions with irregular features. The package includes full MCMC 
    implementations for trend filtering using dynamic shrinkage on signal differences, 
    producing locally constant or linear fits with adaptive credible bands. 
    Also included are models with static shrinkage and normal-inverse-Gamma priors for comparison. 
    Additional tools cover dynamic regression with time-varying coefficients and 
    B-spline models with shrinkage on basis differences, allowing for flexible 
    curve-fitting with unequally spaced data. Some support for heteroscedastic errors, 
    outlier detection, and change point estimation.
